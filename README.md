# Python-RPS-Game

In this project I am deploying <b>python</b> to create a rock paper scissors game.

This standard version of rock, paper, scissors game can be played as human player against four different types of computer player strategies.

These computer player strategiescan be selected at the beginning of the game.

## Running the RPS Game

To play this game, please execute `python3 rps.py` in the terminal.
